# Hi!
My name is Katia and I'm from France ! ðŸ‘‹
  
I'm currently studying Data Science at the University of Bordeaux in France and I'm really passionate about Computer Science.
I started programming a VERY long time ago and I never stopped. I will make various projects and present them here to try to improve my skills.  
I hope you will like them !
